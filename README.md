# BEGAN: Boundary Equibilibrium Generative Adversarial Networks


## What are Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Networks?

Unlike standard generative adversarial networks [(Goodfellow et al. 2014)](#references), boundary equilibrium generative adversarial networks (BEGAN) use an auto-encoder as a disciminator. An auto-encoder loss is defined, and an approximation of the Wasserstein distance is then computed between the pixelwise auto-encoder loss distributions of real and generated samples.

With the auto-encoder loss defined (above), the Wasserstein distance approximation simplifies to a loss function wherein the discriminating auto-encoder aims to perform *well on real samples* and *poorly on generated samples*, while the generator aims to produce adversarial samples which the discriminator can't help but perform well upon.

Additionally, a hyper-parameter gamma is introduced which gives the user the power to control sample diversity by balancing the discriminator and generator.

Gamma is put into effect through the use of a weighting parameter *k* which gets updated while training to adapt the loss function so that our output matches the desired diversity. The overall objective for the network is then:

Unlike most generative adversarial network architectures, where we need to update *G* and *D* independently, the Boundary Equilibrium GAN has the nice property that we can define a global loss and train the network as a whole (though we still have to make sure to update parameters with respect to the relative loss functions)

The final contribution of the paper is a derived convergence measure M which gives a good indicator as to how the network is doing. We use this parameter to track performance, as well as control learning rate.

The overall result is a surprisingly effective model which produces samples well beyond the previous state of the art.
